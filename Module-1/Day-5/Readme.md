L1 Activities Of Structure:

1. Use structures to find the volume and the total surface area of the box.
   You need to access the members of the structure with the help of a structure pointer:
   a. With the help of (\*) asterisk or indirection operator and (.) dot operator.
   b. With the help of ( -> ) Arrow operator using pointer as well as dot representation.
2. Write a C program that uses functions to perform the following operations:
   i) Reading a complex number
   ii) Writing a complex number
   iii) Addition of two complex numbers
   iv) Multiplication of two complex numbers
   (Note: represent complex number using a structure.
3. Write a program using structures to calculate the difference between two time periods using a user-defined function.
4. write a program to Store Data for n students in Structures Dynamically.
5. Write a program to demonstrate the swapping the fields of two structures using pointers
