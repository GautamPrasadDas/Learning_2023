MODULE-1

Day-1/Level-1 :

1. Write a function to find biggest of 2 numbers using
   - if else
   - ternary operator
2. Write a program to print the grade of the given student using if else if block
   - 90 to 100 -> "Grade A"
   - 75 to 89 -> "Grade B"
   - 60 to 74 -> "Grade C"
   - 50 to 59 -> "Grade D"
   - 0 to 49 -> "Grade F"
3. Write a program to read the
   - Roll No
   - Name (Note, you should read full name of the student including initials)
   - Marks of Physics, Math and Chemistry
     Calculate the total, percentage and print the summary.
4. Write a simple calculator program which should accept inputs in the same order. - Operand 1 - Operator - Operand 2
   The order of scan should be same, for example, you should first scan in the following order.
   printf("Enter Number1: );
   Scan the first number form the user.
   printf("Enter the operator: );
   Scan the operator from the user.
   printf("Enter Number2: );
   Scan the second number form the user.
5. Write a function to accept an integer (32 bits) and operation type to do the following and return the result to main function.
   - Set 1st bit, if operation type is 1
   - Clear 31st bit, if operation type is 2
   - Toggle 16th bit, if operation type is 3
     You can consider the below function prototype,
   - bit_operations(int num, int oper_type);
 
Module-2/Day-2
Level-1:

1. Write a program to print exponent part of double variable in hexadecimal and binary format.
lets say we have x = 0.7, the exponent in hex is 0x3FE and 0b01111111110

Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Bitwise Operators
2. Write a program to swap any type of data passed to an function.
Topics to be covered
- Pointers
- Type Casting
3. Write a program to sum every alternate elements of a given array starting for element 0
For example, let's say we have a[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, the result should be 10 + 30 + 50 = 90
Topics to be covered
- Arrays
- Loops
- Basic Operators
4. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits
5. Write a program to find total number of bits set in a given array.
Say we have a array of 3 elements
a[3] = {0x1, 0xF4, 0x10001};
The total number of set bits in the given array is
1 bit in 0x01, 5 in 0xF4, 2 in 0x10001, so the total is 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 bits
